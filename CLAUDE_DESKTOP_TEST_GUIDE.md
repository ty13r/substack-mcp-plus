## Publishing Preparation

## Notes

- Test with a real Substack account but be VERY careful with publish_post
- Consider using a test publication if you have one
- The confirmation system should prevent accidents, but stay alert
- If any test fails, note the exact error message for debugging

Remember: The goal is to ensure a smooth experience for users who will rely on this tool for their publishing workflow!
