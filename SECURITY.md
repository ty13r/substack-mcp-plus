# Security Policy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

**This is an UNOFFICIAL tool** that interacts with Substack's private API endpoints:
- We have no control over Substack's security measures or API changes
- Your credentials are used to authenticate directly with Substack
- We recommend using a dedicated Substack account for automation if possible
- Always comply with Substack's Terms of Service and security policies

## üîê Security Best Practices

When using Substack MCP Plus, please follow these security best practices:

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template and create your own `.env` file
- Store credentials securely and rotate them regularly
- Consider using a secrets management service for production use

### Authentication
- **Email/Password Method** (Recommended):
  - Use a strong, unique password for your Substack account
  - Enable two-factor authentication on your Substack account if available
  
- **Session Token Method** (Alternative):
  - Session tokens expire and need to be refreshed periodically
  - Never share or expose your session tokens
  - Revoke tokens immediately if compromised

### API Usage
- Be mindful of Substack's rate limits
- Implement appropriate error handling and retry logic
- Log errors but never log credentials or sensitive data
