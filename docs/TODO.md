**Tool**: #8 (Removed)
**Error**: 404 with JSON parsing failures

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Wrong Behavior

#### 7. Preview Draft Wrong URL Type ðŸ”´
**Bug**: Generates published URLs instead of draft preview URLs

**Tool**: #9
**Expected**: URL with ?draft_id=XXX parameter

#### 8. Markdown Formatting Not Rendered ðŸ”´
**Bug**: Bold/italic shows as **text** instead of formatted
**Impact**: Posts require manual cleanup in Substack UI

**Tool**: #4

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Cleanup

#### 9. Remove Redundant Tool ðŸ”´
**Bug**: list_drafts_for_deletion duplicates list_drafts functionality
