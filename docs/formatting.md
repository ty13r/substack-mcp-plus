## Basic Text Formatting

### Bold Text
```markdown
**This text is bold**
__This is also bold__
```

### Italic Text
```markdown
*This text is italic*
_This is also italic_
```

### Bold and Italic
```markdown
***This text is both bold and italic***
___This is also bold and italic___
```

### Example
```markdown
In this paragraph, we have **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text***. 
You can mix and match these styles within a sentence.
```

## Headers

Substack supports six levels of headers:

```markdown
# Header 1 - Main Title
## Header 2 - Section Title
### Header 3 - Subsection
#### Header 4 - Sub-subsection
##### Header 5 - Minor Heading
###### Header 6 - Smallest Heading
```

### Best Practices
- Use Header 1 for the main post title
- Use Header 2 for major sections
- Use Header 3-4 for subsections
- Avoid using Headers 5-6 unless necessary

## Lists

### Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)
```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Back to main level

* You can also use asterisks
* Instead of dashes
+ Or plus signs
```

### Ordered Lists (Numbered)
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two
4. Fourth step
```

### Mixed Lists
```markdown
1. First main point
   - Supporting detail
   - Another detail
2. Second main point
   * Sub-point with asterisk
   * Another sub-point
```

## Code and Preformatted Text

### Inline Code
```markdown
Use `inline code` for short code snippets within text.
```

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting
````markdown
```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple greeting function"""
    print("Hello, Substack readers!")
    return True
```

```javascript
function greetReaders() {
  console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
  return { success: true };
}
```

```bash
# Install the package
pip install substack-mcp-plus

# Run the server
python -m src.server
```
````

### Supported Languages
- python
- javascript/js
- typescript/ts
- bash/shell
- html
- css
- json
- yaml
- markdown
- sql
- And many more...

## Links and Images

### Links
```markdown
[Visit my website](https://example.com)
[Email me](mailto:hello@example.com)
[Link with title](https://example.com "Hover text")

# Reference-style links
[Link text][1]
[Another link][example]

[1]: https://example.com
[example]: https://example.org
```

### Images
```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
![Alt text with caption](https://example.com/image.jpg "This is a caption")

# Image with link
[![Clickable image](https://example.com/image.jpg)](https://example.com)
```

### Best Practices for Images
- Always include alt text for accessibility
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images before uploading
- Consider using Substack's CDN for better performance

## Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important quotes or callouts.

> Multi-line blockquotes
> can span multiple lines
> like this.

> You can also nest blockquotes
>> This is a nested quote
>>> And even deeper nesting
```

### Blockquote with Attribution
```markdown
> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> 
> ‚Äî Alan Kay
```

## Horizontal Rules

Use three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---

***

___
```

These create a visual separator between sections.

## Paywall Markers

To separate free and premium content:

```markdown
# Free Content Section

This content is available to all readers...

<!--paywall-->

# Premium Content Section

This content is only for paid subscribers...
```

The `<!--paywall-->` marker tells Substack where to place the paywall.

# The Ultimate Guide to Python Programming

*Published on November 15, 2024*

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on **Python programming**. Whether you're a ***complete beginner*** or looking to level up your skills, this guide has something for you.

## Getting Started

Before we dive in, let's set up your environment:

```bash
# Install Python
brew install python3

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

### Why Python?

Python is popular for several reasons:

- **Easy to learn**: Simple, readable syntax
- **Versatile**: Web development, data science, automation
- **Large community**: Extensive libraries and frameworks
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

> "Python is the second best language for everything."
> 
> ‚Äî Popular programming saying

## Basic Concepts

Let's start with a simple example:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    A function that greets a person by name.
    
    Args:
        name (str): The person's name
    
    Returns:
        str: A greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python."

# Example usage
message = greet("Reader")
print(message)
```

### Key Features to Remember

1. **Indentation matters** - Python uses whitespace
2. **Dynamic typing** - No need to declare variable types
3. **Everything is an object** - Even functions and classes

### Decorators

Decorators are a powerful Python feature:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Done!"
```

### Best Practices

- Use `black` for code formatting
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Test your code with `pytest`

## Working with Images

### Uploading Images

The `upload_image` tool allows you to upload images directly to Substack's CDN:

```python
# Upload from a local file
result = await upload_image(
    source="/path/to/image.jpg",
    optimize_for="web",  # Options: "web", "email", "thumbnail"
    caption="A beautiful sunset"
)

# Upload from a URL
result = await upload_image(
    source="https://example.com/image.jpg",
    optimize_for="email"
)
```

### Image Optimization Options

- **web**: 1456px width, high quality (default)
- **email**: 600px width, optimized for email newsletters
- **thumbnail**: 300px width, lower quality for previews

### Using Images in Posts

Once uploaded, use the CDN URL in your markdown:

```markdown
![Image caption](https://substackcdn.com/image/...)
```

## Tips for Great Formatting

1. **Be Consistent**: Pick a style and stick with it
2. **Use Headers Wisely**: Create a clear hierarchy
3. **Break Up Text**: Use lists, images, and code blocks
4. **Highlight Important Points**: Use bold, italics, and blockquotes
5. **Test Your Formatting**: Preview before publishing
6. **Consider Mobile**: Ensure readability on all devices
7. **Optimize Images**: Use appropriate sizes for different contexts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing line breaks**: Add double line breaks between paragraphs
2. **Code not highlighting**: Ensure you specify the language
3. **Images not showing**: Check URLs are accessible
4. **Lists not formatting**: Ensure proper spacing

### Markdown Variations

Substack supports most CommonMark specifications. If something doesn't work:
- Try alternative syntax (e.g., `*` vs `-` for lists)
- Simplify complex nested structures
- Use HTML as a fallback for advanced formatting
