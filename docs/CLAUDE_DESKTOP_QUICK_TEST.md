6. `preview_draft` - Generates preview link
7. `list_drafts_for_deletion` - Shows drafts with delete instructions

### üü° Medium Risk Tools (Create Content)
8. `create_formatted_post` - Creates new drafts (with confirmation)
9. `duplicate_post` - Copies existing posts (with confirmation)
10. `upload_image` - Uploads images to CDN

### üî¥ High Risk Tools (Modify/Delete Content)
11. `update_post` - Updates existing drafts (with confirmation)
12. `delete_draft` - Deletes drafts (with confirmation)
13. `schedule_post` - Schedules for auto-publish (with confirmation)
14. `publish_post` - PUBLISHES AND SENDS EMAILS (with confirmation)

## Essential Test Scenarios

### 1. Test the Confirmation System
```
Say: "Create a draft titled 'Test' with content 'test'"
EXPECT: ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIRMATION REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è
Say: "no"
VERIFY: Nothing created

Say: "Create a draft titled 'Test' with content 'test'"  
Say: "yes"
VERIFY: Draft created
```

### 2. Test Partial Updates
```
Say: "Update draft [ID] subtitle to 'New Subtitle Only'"
EXPECT: Shows ONLY subtitle will change
Say: "yes"
VERIFY: Only subtitle changed on Substack.com
```

### 3. Test Rich Formatting
```
Create a draft with:
# Header
**Bold** and *italic*
- List items
```code block```
> Quote
<!--paywall-->
Premium content

VERIFY: All formatting appears correctly on Substack
```

### 4. Test Safety Features
```
For each risky tool:
1. Try the action
2. Get confirmation prompt
3. Say "no" or "cancel"
4. Verify nothing happened
```
