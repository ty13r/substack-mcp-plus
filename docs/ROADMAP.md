## üéØ Project Vision

Our goal is to make Substack MCP Plus the most powerful and reliable automation tool for Substack creators. While we've built a solid foundation with 14 tools and rich text support, there's still exciting work ahead!

## üöÄ Next Steps We'd Love to See

### High Priority Features

#### 1. Fix Text Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Bold/italic text shows as markdown syntax instead of formatted text  
**Solution**: Deep dive into Substack's text mark handling to properly format text nodes  
**Impact**: Would make posts truly publication-ready without manual editing  
**Difficulty**: Medium - requires understanding Substack's undocumented format  

#### 2. Implement Rate Limiting
**Problem**: No protection against hitting API limits  
**Solution**: Add configurable rate limiting with exponential backoff  
**Impact**: Prevents API errors and account issues  
**Difficulty**: Easy - standard implementation pattern  

#### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery
**Problem**: Some errors require manual intervention  
**Solution**: Add automatic retry logic and better error messages  
**Impact**: More reliable automation  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

### Medium Priority Features

#### 4. Batch Operations
**Feature**: Process multiple posts at once  
**Use Cases**: 
- Bulk scheduling
- Mass updates to existing posts
- Archive operations
**Difficulty**: Medium - need to handle rate limits carefully  

#### 5. Template System
**Feature**: Save and reuse post templates  
**Use Cases**:
- Newsletter formats
- Series posts
- Consistent styling
**Difficulty**: Easy - could use JSON/YAML templates  

#### 6. Advanced Scheduling
**Feature**: Recurring schedules and smart timing  
**Use Cases**:
- Weekly newsletter automation
- Optimal time scheduling based on timezone
- Series scheduling
**Difficulty**: Medium  

### Nice-to-Have Features

#### 7. Analytics Integration
**Feature**: Fetch and display post performance  
**Limitations**: Depends on what Substack's private API exposes  
**Use Cases**:
- Performance tracking
- A/B testing support
- Engagement reports
**Difficulty**: Hard - limited API access  

#### 8. Media Management
**Feature**: Better image/media handling  
**Ideas**:
- Automatic image optimization
- Gallery support
- Video embedding helpers
**Difficulty**: Medium  

#### 9. Subscriber Management
**Feature**: Basic subscriber operations  
**Limitations**: Heavily restricted by API  
**Ideas**:
- Export subscriber lists
- Segment management
- Welcome email automation
**Difficulty**: Hard - API limitations  

#### 10. AI-Powered Enhancements
**Feature**: Leverage AI for content improvement  
**Ideas**:
- SEO optimization suggestions
- Readability analysis
- Auto-generate excerpts
- Title optimization
**Difficulty**: Medium - integrate with AI services
