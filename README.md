## üí¨ Examples of What to Expect

Here's what you can say to Claude Desktop and what each tool will do:

### Creating Content
**You say:** "Create a new Substack draft about AI and the future of work"  
**What happens:** Creates a draft post with your content, returns the post ID and URL  
**Claude shows:** "I've created a draft post titled 'AI and the Future of Work' (ID: 123456)"

**You say:** "Write a post with a paywall after the introduction"  
**What happens:** Creates a draft with free preview content and premium content separated by `<!--paywall-->`  
**Claude shows:** "Draft created with paywall marker. Free readers will see the intro, subscribers get full access."

### Managing Posts
**You say:** "Show me my last 5 drafts"  
**What happens:** Lists your most recent draft posts with titles, IDs, and dates  
**Claude shows:** A formatted list like:
```
1. "AI and the Future of Work" (ID: 123456) - Created 2 hours ago
2. "Weekly Newsletter #42" (ID: 123455) - Created yesterday
3. "Book Review: Deep Work" (ID: 123454) - Created 3 days ago
```

**You say:** "Update the subtitle of draft 123456 to 'How automation will reshape careers'"  
**What happens:** Updates only the subtitle field of the specified draft  
**Claude shows:** "Updated post subtitle. Note: This replaces the entire subtitle field."

**You say:** "Publish my latest draft"  
**What happens:** Publishes the draft immediately to your subscribers  
**Claude shows:** "Post published! It's now live at: https://yourpub.substack.com/p/ai-and-future-work"

### Working with Content
**You say:** "Show me what's in my published post about remote work"  
**What happens:** Retrieves and displays the full formatted content of the post  
**Claude shows:** The complete post content in readable markdown format

**You say:** "Make a copy of my most popular post to use as a template"  
**What happens:** Creates a new draft with identical content but titled "Copy of [original]"  
**Claude shows:** "Created draft 'Copy of Your Popular Post' (ID: 123457)"

**You say:** "Upload the chart image from my desktop"  
**What happens:** Uploads the image to Substack's CDN and returns the URL  
**Claude shows:** "Image uploaded successfully: https://substackcdn.com/image/..."

### Analytics & Management
**You say:** "How many subscribers do I have?"  
**What happens:** Retrieves your current subscriber count  
**Claude shows:** "You have 1,234 subscribers on https://yourpub.substack.com"

**You say:** "What sections does my publication have?"  
**What happens:** Lists all your publication's sections/categories  
**Claude shows:** "Your publication has these sections: Newsletter, Essays, Book Reviews, Podcast"

**You say:** "Generate a preview link for draft 123456"  
**What happens:** Creates an author-only preview URL for sharing  
**Claude shows:** "Preview link: https://yourpub.substack.com/p/ai-and-future-work?preview=true"

**You say:** "Delete that test draft I created earlier"  
**What happens:** Asks for confirmation, then permanently deletes the draft  
**Claude shows:** "Are you sure you want to delete 'Test Post'? Please confirm."

### Important Notes
- All formatting (bold, italic, lists, code blocks) is preserved when creating posts
- The tool handles authentication automatically - no manual token management needed
- Draft posts are saved instantly and can be edited in Substack's web editor too
- Published posts go live immediately to all your subscribers

## üí≠ Why We Built This

> "So many ideas, little time to actually publish them."

I'm a product guy with countless ideas swirling in my head. Before LLMs, writing was the bottleneck. Now with Claude and ChatGPT producing detailed articles in minutes, I realized **publishing had become the new constraint**.

### The Journey

After spending 2-3 frustrating hours trying to set up an existing Substack MCP server (involving stealing session tokens from browser dev tools!), we finally got it working. We were ecstatic... until we tried to publish our first post.

**All formatting was gone. Plain text only.**

Our hopes were crushed, but from that disappointment came determination. Why hadn't anyone built on the battle-tested `python-substack` library? This was our opportunity.

### The Experiment

As someone who hadn't written production code since 2018, I wanted to test a theory: **Could AI agents build production-quality software with proper planning and TDD?**

The answer was a resounding yes. Using Claude Code with strict Test-Driven Development:
- Write failing tests first
- Implement code to pass those tests
- No hallucinations, no massive errors
- I was "the equivalent of Homer Simpson running the nuclear power plant"

**The result?** In under 24 hours, we built the most powerful Substack MCP server available. **And I didn't write a single line of code.**

### Our Vision

This isn't just about one tool. It's about:
- **Empowering creators** to ship ideas without friction
- **Inspiring developers** to build on this foundation
- **Proving what's possible** with AI-assisted development
- **Setting the standard** for what publishing automation should be

Because when publishing is frictionless, ideas flow freely.

## üìù Known Limitations

**[‚Üí See detailed documentation in KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)**

### Formatting & Display
- **Text formatting** shows as markdown syntax (`**bold**`, `*italic*`) instead of formatted text
- **Links** display as `[text](url)` instead of clickable links  
- **Images** may show as `![alt](url)` instead of rendered images
- **Blockquotes** display with `>` prefix instead of styled blocks

### API & Feature Limitations
- **No rate limiting** - be mindful of Substack's undocumented API limits
- **Subscriber count** may show 0 even with active subscribers (API limitation)
- **Post scheduling removed** in v1.0.3 due to outdated API endpoint (404 errors)
- **Preview links** are author-only (shareable links require UUID access not available)

### Unsupported Features
- No collaborative posts, threads, or podcast episodes
- No analytics beyond subscriber count (views, opens, engagement)
- No custom CSS, JavaScript, or embedded content (tweets, videos)
- Maximum post size limits are undocumented

### Technical Constraints
- Uses **unofficial reverse-engineered API** that may change without notice
- **python-substack library** hasn't been updated in 2+ years
- Session tokens expire and require re-authentication
- Some accounts with advanced security may have issues

**Workaround**: Create drafts with this tool, then use Substack's web editor for final formatting touches before publishing.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Credentials

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
   - Use the provided `.env.example` as a template
   - Create your own `.env` file with your actual credentials
   - The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` for your protection

2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
   - Don't reuse your Substack password elsewhere
   - Consider using a password manager
   - Enable two-factor authentication on your Substack account if available

3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - Change your Substack password periodically
   - If using session tokens, refresh them when they expire
   - Immediately change credentials if you suspect they've been compromised

### Secure Configuration

When configuring your MCP client:
- Store credentials in environment variables, not in code
- Use the most restrictive file permissions for configuration files
- Avoid logging or printing credentials
- Be cautious when sharing configuration examples

### Reporting Security Issues

Found a security vulnerability? Please **DO NOT** create a public issue. Instead:
1. Check our [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file for reporting guidelines
2. Report privately to maintain responsible disclosure
3. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

For more security information, see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).
