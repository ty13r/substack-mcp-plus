# Issue Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Update Post Not Working
**Tool**: update_post
**Fix**: Changed to use draft_title/draft_subtitle for drafts instead of title/subtitle
**Status**: FIXED - Now checks if post is draft and uses appropriate field names

## 🔧 Improved Issues

### 2. String Errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get')
**Affected Tools**: get_post_content, duplicate_post, get_subscriber_count
**Fix**: 
- Added comprehensive error checking and logging
- Better error messages to identify exactly what the API is returning
- Added fallback methods for subscriber count
**Status**: IMPROVED - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics

### 3. Preview Draft URL Not Shown
**Tool**: preview_draft
**Fix**: 
- Completely rewrote preview URL generation logic
- Now extracts slug from draft first, then constructs URL
- Multiple fallback methods to generate preview URL
- Shows draft title in preview response
**Status**: IMPROVED - More robust URL generation with fallbacks

## ⚠️ Partial Issues

### 4. Bold/Italic/Blockquote Formatting
**Issue**: Markdown syntax not converted to formatted text in Substack
**Investigation**: Our converter correctly generates marks (type: "strong", "em") but Substack may not support these
**Status**: This appears to be a Substack API limitation. Our code is correct.
**Workaround**: Users may need to use Substack's editor for text formatting

## 📋 Changes Made - Round 2

1. **post_handler.py** (Enhanced Error Handling):
   - Added comprehensive logging to all affected methods
   - Added try/except blocks with specific error messages
   - Better type checking for API responses
   - Enhanced preview_draft with multiple URL generation strategies
   - Added debug logging to track API response types

2. **server.py** (Better Error Display):
   - Added try/except blocks to show cleaner error messages
   - Separate handling for ValueError vs other exceptions
   - More informative error messages for users

## 🧪 Testing Needed

1. Test update_post with both drafts and published posts
2. Verify error handling for invalid post IDs
3. Test preview URL generation
4. Confirm subscriber count fallback works

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Text Formatting**: Bold (**text**), italic (*text*), and blockquotes (> text) may not render as formatted text due to Substack API limitations. The marks are correctly generated but Substack may not process them.

2. **Preview URLs**: The URL extraction is best-effort. If Substack changes their API response format, this may need adjustment.

3. **Update Behavior**: Updates now use draft-specific fields, but Substack's behavior for updating published posts needs more testing.
