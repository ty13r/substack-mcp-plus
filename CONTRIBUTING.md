## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/substack-mcp-plus.git
   cd substack-mcp-plus
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards

3. Write or update tests as needed

4. Run tests to ensure everything passes:
   ```bash
   pytest
   npm test  # if applicable
   ```

5. Format your code:
   ```bash
   black src tests
   mypy src
   ```

### Coding Standards

#### Python Code Style

* Follow PEP 8
* Use Black for formatting (line length: 88)
* Use type hints where possible
* Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes
* Keep functions focused and small
* Prefer descriptive variable names

#### JavaScript Code Style

* Use ES6+ features
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for functions
* Keep functions small and focused

#### General Guidelines

* **ABOUTME Comments**: All code files should start with two "ABOUTME:" comment lines explaining what the file does
* **No Mocks**: We use real data and real APIs - never implement mock modes
* **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully with informative messages
* **Security**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive information

### Testing

* **Write Tests First (TDD)**: We practice Test-Driven Development
  1. Write a failing test
  2. Write minimal code to make it pass
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green
  
* **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=src
  ```

* **Test Types**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

Example:
```
feat: add support for scheduling posts

- Add schedule_post tool to MCP server
- Update post handler to support scheduled_at parameter
- Add tests for scheduling functionality

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

* Update the README.md if you change functionality
* Update or add documentation in the docs/ folder as needed
* Keep examples up to date
* Document any new environment variables or configuration options
